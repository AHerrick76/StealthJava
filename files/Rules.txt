StealthJava is a puzzle game with the goal of collecting a piece of treasure without getting caught by any wandering guards. In each level, the player must
navigate a board or maze to reach the goal while making sure to avoid any zones of detection. StealthJava consists of 20 levels of escalating difficulty. The 
first few levels are straightforward, intended to familiarize the player with the basic mechanics, but the puzzles eventually become quite difficult and precise!

The display screen contains a few items of note:
	- The top of the screen contains 4 buttons, which display the rules, reset the current level, or transition to the next or previous level in the queue.
	- The bottom of the screen tracks the current turn, and whether the player has won or lost.
	- The central "grid" shows the field of play. Players (and Guards!) move horizontally or vertically along the grid each turn.
	- The blue-clad person with a red shield represents the player.
	- The purple and red altar represents the goal in each level (it may be hidden if a guard is blocking it at first).
	- The yellow circles indicate the guard's cone of vision. Standing on any yellow circle will spell defeat!
	- Centaurs, paladins, and imps all represent different types of guards, explained later.
	- Darkened solid squares represent walls - nothing can move onto or through them. But beware! Guards can see through the walls (they're equipped with X-Ray glasses, say)
	- The floor tiles (where objects are stand) are typically a brighter or less saturated color, to differentiate them from walls.

To control the player, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move in each direction. You can also press the spacebar to skip your turn - this is helpful if you need to wait for a guard
to move out of the way to progress. If your move fails - because there is a guard or wall in the way - the turn won't advance.

Types of guards:
	- Random Guards - each turn, they move in a random direction, if any unblocked direction exists. These appear as red, many armed imps.
	- Route or Patrol Guards - each turn, they move along a set patrol, before reversing course. If an object blocks their path, they'll continue along their same patrol
	as before once the object moves. (You can use this to block their movement, a key strategy in some levels!). These appear as a armor-clad sentinel.
	- Hunter or Chase Guards - these are the most difficult guard to evade. Each turn, these guards will chase down the player, moving toward the player along the axis
	of greatest distance. If they can't, they'll move along the second axis instead. Find ways to trap these guards before they get too close -- you can't outrun them!
	These appear as bow wielding centaurs.

Strategy Tips!
	- The walls and floor will change when a player encounters a new difficulty tier of levels. Often these changes indicate a new design concept being used, or a new strategy
	now required to progress!
	- Players are detected AFTER all guards resolve their movement. It's possible to move onto a "Detected" square and remain uncaught, provided the guard viewing that area moves
	during its turn. This is very important in some levels!
	- If you step onto the victory square, you win - if a guard spots you when you reach the goal, it's too late for them to catch you!
	- Guards can either detect you in a circle around themselves or in an expanding cone pointing toward whichever way they are facing (based on their last move). Be careful
	to move carefully near guards with long vision cones, they can move unexpectedly!
	- It is often best to let Hunter guards get close, or at least bunched up, before trying to evade. If they surround you, it's very easy to get cornered.
	- It may be advantageous to remember certain classic video game trivia or lore :)


Expansion-Specific Mechanics:
	- Locked Doors: Colored, impassable squares represent color-coded locked doors. In order to open them, you'll need to find the corresponding key. 
	- Dark Levels: Some levels only show you the area of the map immediately surrounding your character (you can see through walls though). The guards can see 
		normally though, so be careful!
